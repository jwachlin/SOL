# SOL
Long-term solar intensity sensing

People considering a photovoltaic installation on their property should be able to make a data-driven decision about the viability of such a system. While projects such as Google's Project Sunroof can provide large-scale estimates of solar intensity from satellite images, SOL will be able to provide data that incorporates local effects such as roof slope and direction, tree cover, or obstruction from nearby buildings.
